XellR is intended to address a critical pain point for business owners who are overwhelmed by fragmented data across e-commerce platforms. The platform streamlines these processes into three simple steps:

* Upload your e-commerce sales data

* Analyze the key trends and patterns

* Decide based on data-driven insights

## Project overview: AI-Powered Chart Narration
As part of a 4-month group internship at Xeratic, we worked on an R&D project to develop an AI-powered narrative feature for the XellR platform. The goal was to transform sales data visualizations (charts) into insightful, human-readable narratives that help business owners make faster and smarter decisions.

## Objective
To convert important findings from sales analytics charts into textual insights using natural language generation (NLG) powered by OpenAI's GPT via Azure OpenAI Service.

## Technical Highlights
During this project, we:
* Processed and analyzed sales data from multiple sources 
* Developed chart-based analytics using tools such as matplotlib and plotly
* Implemented prompt engineering techniques to guide GPT models in generating accurate, business-relevant insights
* Integrated Azure OpenAI services into a prototype system
* Delivered a proof-of-concept (PoC) AI module that converts graphs into readable summaries
